  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: November 2025</small></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to ThinkLater (“the App”). By downloading, installing, or using this App, you agree to
    be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Premium and Payment</h2>
  <p>
    ThinkLater offers optional Premium features that can be unlocked via a one-time purchase.
    Premium is <strong>not</strong> a subscription.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li>
      The transaction is processed by Apple via the App Store. We do not handle or store your
      card or payment details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Access to Premium features is associated with your Apple ID, subject to Apple’s terms,
      device compatibility, and your account status.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any refund requests must be made directly to Apple and are governed by Apple’s refund
    policies. We cannot grant or manage refunds ourselves.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided for personal, non-commercial use only. By using the App, you agree that you
    will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App only for lawful purposes;</li>
    <li>Not attempt to disrupt, hack, or interfere with the App’s normal operation;</li>
    <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or copy significant parts of the App;</li>
    <li>Not circumvent or attempt to circumvent any purchase, Premium, or advertising mechanism;</li>
    <li>Not use the App in a way that could harm or impair others’ use of the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Notifications and Decision Timers</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses local notifications to remind you when a decision’s cool-down period has ended.
    These alerts are not guaranteed to be delivered in real time and must not be relied upon as
    emergency alerts or life-critical notifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can enable or disable notifications through your device’s system settings. If disabled,
    certain features may not work as intended.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    ThinkLater is designed to store your decision data locally on your device. We do not build
    central user profiles or require a login account for the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your use of the App may, however, involve platform-level services (e.g. iCloud backups, diagnostics,
    or the App Store) that are provided and controlled by Apple and subject to Apple’s own terms and policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All intellectual property rights in and to the App (including its name, logo, design, and
    underlying software) remain with the developer. These Terms do not transfer any ownership rights
    to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App on
    devices you own or control, solely for personal use and in accordance with these Terms of Use and
    any applicable App Store rules.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties of any kind,
    whether express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose or
    non-infringement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App is a decision-support and reflection tool only. It does not provide medical, psychological,
    financial, or legal advice. You are solely responsible for your decisions and for how you use (or
    choose not to use) the App’s suggestions or reminders.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent allowed by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
    consequential, special, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to loss of profits,
    data, or reputation arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the App is to stop using it and, if
    applicable, request a refund directly from Apple under their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms of Use from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated”
    date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes means that you accept
    the revised Terms.
  </p>
