  <h2 id="terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to ThinkLater (“App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these
    Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before using the App.
  </p>

  <h3>1. About the App</h3>
  <p>
    ThinkLater is a decision delay and reflection tool. It allows you to create “active decisions”
    with a cool-down timer, receive a local notification when the timer ends, and optionally unlock
    additional functionality through a one-time Premium purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App is designed for personal self-reflection and decision-making support only. It does not
    provide medical, psychological, financial, or legal advice and must not be used as a substitute
    for professional help.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Eligibility &amp; Acceptable Use</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App.</li>
    <li>You may use the App only for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
    <li>
      You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using the App.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Premium Purchase &amp; Payments</h3>
  <p>
    The App offers optional Premium features that can be unlocked via a one-time in-app purchase.
    Premium may include, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom decision delay durations;</li>
    <li>Ability to end an active decision early;</li>
    <li>Removal of in-app advertising in the free version;</li>
    <li>Additional configuration and personalization options.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store using your Apple ID. We do not receive
    or store your credit card or payment account details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once purchased, Premium is tied to your Apple ID and is not a subscription. It is intended as a
    one-time unlock for that App on compatible Apple platforms, subject to Apple’s policies, your
    account status, and any future changes Apple may introduce.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Refunds</h3>
  <p>
    We do not directly provide refunds. Any refund requests must be made through Apple and are subject
    to Apple’s own refund policies. Please refer to Apple Support if you wish to request a refund for
    an in-app purchase.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Advertising</h3>
  <p>
    The free version of the App may display third-party advertisements. These ads are provided via
    third-party advertising networks integrated into the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not control the content of third-party ads and are not responsible for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The accuracy, legality, or appropriateness of any advertisements; or</li>
    <li>Any products or services offered by third parties.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any dealings you have with advertisers are solely between you and the advertiser.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Notifications</h3>
  <p>
    ThinkLater uses local notifications to remind you when an active decision reaches its end time.
    These notifications are scheduled and triggered on your device and are not sent from our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can control notification permissions via your device’s system settings. If you disable
    notifications, some features of the App (such as decision reminders) may not work as intended.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Data &amp; Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    ThinkLater is designed to keep your decision data on your device. The App does not create its own
    user accounts, does not require login, and does not build a central user database.
  </p>
  <p>In particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your decision entries and settings are stored locally on your device (and in your system
      backup if enabled, e.g. iCloud or iTunes backup).
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not collect or store any personally identifiable decision content on our own servers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any emails or messages you send to us for support may contain personal data that you
      voluntarily provide. We will use such information only to respond to your enquiry.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you uninstall the App, local data stored by the App on that device is typically removed. Data
    stored as part of your device backups is managed by you and your platform provider (e.g. Apple).
  </p>

  <h3>8. Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>
    The App, including its name, design, user interface, text, graphics, and underlying software, is
    owned by the developer and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.
  </p>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy, modify, adapt, or create derivative works of the App;</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App;</li>
    <li>Resell, sublicense, or redistribute the App without our prior written consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>9. Health &amp; Risk Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>
    The App provides tools for delaying decisions and reflecting on choices. It does not diagnose,
    treat, or prevent any mental health condition, and is not a replacement for professional advice
    from a doctor, psychologist, or other qualified professional.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you experience significant distress, anxiety, or other health-related issues, you should seek
    help from a qualified professional or contact local emergency services or crisis hotlines.
  </p>

  <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental,
    consequential, special, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or reputation arising
    from your use of or inability to use the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your use of the App is at your own risk. You are solely responsible for the decisions you make,
    including any decisions you delay or change while using the App.
  </p>

  <h3>11. Changes to the App and These Terms</h3>
  <p>
    We may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the App at any time, including introducing new
    features or removing existing ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page
    will reflect the latest version. Your continued use of the App after any changes means you accept
    the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h3>12. Governing Law</h3>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in your country or region, without regard to
    conflict-of-law rules. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the App complies with
    local laws where you live.
